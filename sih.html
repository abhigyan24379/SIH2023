          While dinosaurs weren't exactly geniuses, some of them were really active,
     both physically and mentally. The two carnivorous species of dinosaurs, 
     namely Deinonychus as well as Velociraptor were quite agile, smart and 
     had the speed similar to that of a kickboxer.
     <br>
     According to some paleontologists and theorists, birds have been said to
      have evolved from dinosaurs. Most birds have structures that are somewhat
       similar to small, feathered, theropod dinosaurs and hence, it probably 
       might have happened over centuries and multiple evolutionary stages.
    <br>
     So technically, dinosaurs still live among us!

    Polar bears have black skin. This helps it to absorb heat from the sun to 
    stay warm in an Arctic climate, and it likely protects the bear from harmful UV rays.

    A single strand of spider silk is thinner than a human hair, but also five 
    times stronger than steel of the same width. A rope just 2 inches thick could 
    reportedly stop a Boeing 747.
